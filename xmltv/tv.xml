<desc lang="en">Allan Chapman presents this new five-part series profiling some of the most brilliant and influential scientists in history, charting their incalculable impact on modern civilisation. He begins with ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle, a pupil of Plato whose prolific writings defined the future course of scientific enquiry by analysing the natural world as a unified whole governed by certain laws. Although some of the concepts Aristotle formulated have since become outmoded or unfashionable, he remains a towering figure in intellectual history</desc>

<desc lang="en">Account of the life and death of British racing driver Richard Seaman, whose victory in the 1938 German Grand Prix was allowed to sink into historical oblivion because of his decision to join the Mercedes team. Although initially seduced by the prospect of driving Germany's technically advanced Silver Arrow cars, Seaman gradually came to realise the true nature of the Nazi regime -- but still could not resist the challenge of competing in the 1939 Grand Prix. It was a choice which proved fatal, as his car skidded off the track and burst into flames in circumstances which remain mysterious</desc>

<title lang="en">Ultimate Explosions</title>
<desc lang="en">Tiff Needell narrates this documentary about an immense unexploded World War One bomb found under a Belgian farmhouse, the sinister product of an arms race that would eventually lead to Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The programme reveals how a series of tunnels were packed with explosives by the Allies during the conflict in an effort to secure a strategic ridge, but four remained undetonated. One was destroyed by lightning in 1955, harming no-one, and two still exist under open fields -- but the shocking discovery that another is now lying under a working farmhouse has forced experts to attempt to resolve the situation before disaster strikes</desc>

<desc lang="en">David Attenborough investigates the feeding habits of omnivores, a group of animals that find a non-specialist diet is the secret of success in an ever-changing environment -- an eating plan that has worked for humans throughout history. Some of these mammals have special talents -- raccoons have sensitive paws to seek out food on land and underwater, babirusa pigs have a strong sense of smell to detect the scent of ripe fruit through dense jungle -- and others are opportunists, such as Texan skunks, feasting on baby bats as they fall to the ground from cave walls, and grizzly bears which consume a staggering 30,000 calories a day when salmon are available</desc>

<desc lang="en">Design duo Colin McAllister and Justin Ryan's next project is a Fifties four-bedroom house in Harrogate, hoping to make it more modern so it stands out from the crowd. However, project manager Nigel Leck is convinced they have bitten off more than they can chew -- the team have never tackled a family home before -- and storms out of a design meeting. His fears may prove accurate as, with costs rising and the house sitting on the market, Justin and Colin are forced to admit that their design might be a bit too contemporary, and matters are made worse when the kitchen floods. Is the property challenge doomed?</desc>
